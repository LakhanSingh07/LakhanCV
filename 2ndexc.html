    <h1>Blockchain</h1>
    <hr/>
    <p>A <b>blockchain</b> is a <a href="">distributed ledger</a> with growing lists of <a href="">records</a> (blocks) that are securely linked together via <a href="">cryptographic hashes.<sup>[1][2][3][4]</sup></a>  Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data (generally represented as a Merkle tree, where data nodes are represented by leaves). Since each block contains information about the previous block, they effectively form a chain (compare linked list data structure), with each additional block linking to the ones before it. Consequently, blockchain transactions are resistant to alteration because, once recorded, the data in any given block cannot be changed retroactively without altering all subsequent blocks and obtaining network consensus to accept these changes. This protects blockchains against nefarious activities such as creating assets <b>"out of thin air"</b>, double-spending, counterfeiting, fraud, and theft.<a href="">[5]</a>
<br/>
<br/>
        <em>Blockchains are typically managed by a peer-to-peer (P2P) computer network for use as a public distributed ledger</em>, where nodes collectively adhere to a consensus algorithm protocol to add and validate new transaction blocks. Although blockchain records are not unalterable, since blockchain forks are possible, blockchains may be considered secure by design and exemplify a distributed computing system with high Byzantine fault tolerance.<a href="">[6]</a></p>

        <p>Logically, a blockchain can be seen as consisting of several layers:<a href="">cryptographic hashes.<sup>[25]</sup></a></p>
        <ul>
            <li>infrastructure (hardware)</li>
            <li><a href="">networking</a> (node discovery, information propagation<a href=""><sup>[26]</sup></a> and verification)</li>
            <li>consensus (proof of work, proof of stake)</li>
            <li><a href="">data (blocks, transactions)</a></li>
            <li> <a href="">application (smart contracts/decentralized applications,</a> if applicable)</li>
        </ul>
